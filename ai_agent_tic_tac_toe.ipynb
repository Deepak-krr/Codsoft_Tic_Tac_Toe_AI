The game is explored until endgames are reached and these endgames are evaluated to see if their are victories or defeats (or draws). Then, a situation in which every move leads to a defeat is labelled as a (certain) defeat, and a situation in which one move leads to a (certain) defeat of the opponent is labelled as a (certain) victory.

The value assigned to each move is the negative of the value assigned by the opponent for their best move, hence the name \"negamax\". By negating the opponent's score, the algorithm takes into account the fact that the opponent is trying to minimize the player's score. The algorithm continues to explore the game tree until it reaches a terminal state, at which point it assigns a score to the position based on whether the player won, lost, or drew the game.
